A population pyramid, also called an "age-sex-pyramid" or "mirror bar chart", is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population.

By combining and linking the pyramid with a <a href="https://www.amcharts.com/demos/stacked-area/">stacked area chart</a> we are able to create a compact and interactive visualization covering a lot of historical date.
